Open Source Overview
============================
This project is a Noblis Sponsored Research Project that provides an example of how to use anonymized Connected Vehicle (CV) Basic Safety Messages (BSM) in aggregate to visualize roadway conditions using Open Data provided by the United States Department of Transportation through the ITS Public Data Hub. The video below shows the visualization in Google Earth, with hypothetical vehicle trajectories representing traffic over a defined route every five minutes.
